IBA works by showing you advertisements that are based on the type of content you access or read. For example, as you browse our website, one of the cookies placed on your device will be an advertising cookie so we can better understand what sort of pages or content you are interested in. The information collected about your device enables us to group you with other devices that have shown similar interests. We can then display advertising to categories of users that is based on common interests. For more information about IBA, please vi</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sit: </span><a href="http://www.iab.net/public_policy/behavioral-advertisingprinciples" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.iab.net/public_policy/behavioral-advertisingprinciples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

This will allow you to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, have your browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether. However, because cookies allow you to more easily navigate web sites, you may prefer to leave them turned on. If you are accessing the internet through an alternative method, such as a mobile application or third-party content distribution service, you understand that you may not have the ability to disable cookies, depending on the specific access method.</span></p>
                                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising, it does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising when you are using our website. It just means that we will not use information collected about you for IBA and that any advertising you see will not be customized or relevant to you. You can exercise your online advertising choices at </span><a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://optout.aboutads.info</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by clicking the AdChoices icon in an ad and following the instructions. You&nbsp;may also opt out of receiving interest-based ads from many sites through the Network Advertising Initiative's (NAI)&nbsp;Opt Out Tool (</span><a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;and in the EU at </span><a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Remember, if you delete cookies, use a different device, or change web browsers, you may need to opt out again.</span></p>
                                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile devices have an identifier that gives companies the ability to serve targeted ads to a specific mobile device. In many cases, you can turn off mobile device ad tracking or you can reset the advertising identifier at any time within your mobile device privacy settings. Another tool you can use to control advertising on your mobile device is the AppChoices App: </span><a href="http://youradchoices.com/appchoices" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://youradchoices.com/appchoices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You may also choose to turn off location tracking on your mobile device. If you turn off ad tracking or location tracking, we will no longer use information collected from your device's advertising identifier for the purposes of advertising. You may still see the same number of ads but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interests.</span></p>
